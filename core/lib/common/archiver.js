/**
 * # Send reports/artifacts from testbot back to client
 *
 * By default, serial logs (given that the hardware is set up correctly), and the
 * logs from the tests will be sent back to the client that started the test, upon
 * the test finishing. Other artifacts can be sent back to the client using the
 * `archiver` method. This method is available within any test:
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * this.archiver.add(`path/of/FILE`)
 * ```
 *
 * Using this method, at the end of the test, any artifacts added to the archive are compressed and
 * downloaded by the client. These are available in the `workspace/reports` directory at the end of
 * the test. This can also be helpful when storing artifacts/reports/logs after a test suite run.
 *
